# CFS_Scheduler
Part 1: Compiling the source code
The linux 3.19.0 source code is downloaded and it's
extracted.
- cd to that directory
- do 'cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config' to copy the
kernel's .config file then followed by 'make menuconfig'
- use 'sudo make -j 4 && sudo make modules_install -j 4 &&
sudo make install -j 4'.The kernel and modules are compiled.
- do 'update-initramfs -c -k 3.19.0' to update the kernel,
and 'update-grub' to add it to the grub.

Part 2: Modifying CFS
- Updated /include/linux/sched.h task struct to include srt flags and requirements.
- Updated /kernel/sched/fair.c to include the required scheduling policy for SRT tasks.

Part 3: Making 'rtnice' System Call
- Made info directory in the kernel.
- 'info' directory includes:
       ---- rtnice.c - C code for System call implementation.
       ---- rtnice.h - header file.
       ---- Makefile - Makefile for c code.
       
- Updated arch/x86/syscalls/syscall64.tbl to include the 'rtnice' system call.
- Updated Linux kernel main Makefile to include the 'rtnice' system call.

Part 4: Testing
- rtnicetest.c tests the rtnice system call and the modified cfs scheduler.
-- ERRORS:
	1. if no task with given PID exists.
	2. if timeslice < 1 or greater than a certain value.
